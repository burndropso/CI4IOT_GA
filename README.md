The goal of this project was to create an intelligent system for optimizing garbage truck routes in the Oeiras Municipality. This system will handle up to 100 EcoPoints, where recyclable materials are deposited. The EcoPoints communicate their fill status daily to the Central. The system must quickly determine the shortest route for the truck to collect materials from all EcoPoints, considering a 20-minute decision window and a maximum of 50 locations. The goal is to minimize travel time and ensure timely collection without overtime for workers.

The file “Project3_DistancesMatrix.xls”, that contains distances between each of the 100 EcoPoints.
